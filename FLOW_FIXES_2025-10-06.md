# Flow Graph Fixes - October 6, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pan/Navigation Controls Not Working

**Problem:** The hand button and spacebar pan functionality were not working properly in the flow graph.

**Solution:** Added multiple navigation methods:

- **Arrow Keys**: Now you can use keyboard arrow keys (‚Üê‚Üë‚Üì‚Üí) to pan the graph
- **Pan Direction Buttons**: Added 4 directional arrow buttons to the toolbar for easy panning
- **Zoom Controls**: Added zoom in (+), zoom out (-), and fit-to-view (‚ä°) buttons
- **Improved Event Filter**: Enhanced the spacebar/arrow key event filter to properly handle keyboard navigation

**New Toolbar Buttons:**

- ‚Üë Pan Up (or use Up Arrow key)
- ‚Üì Pan Down (or use Down Arrow key)
- ‚Üê Pan Left (or use Left Arrow key)
- ‚Üí Pan Right (or use Right Arrow key)
- üîç+ Zoom In
- üîç- Zoom Out
- ‚ä° Fit to View

### 2. App Crash During Flow Execution

**Problem:** When running a flow with 5 OpenRouter LLM nodes, a progress window opened but then the entire app crashed without explanation. No activity was recorded on OpenRouter.

**Root Causes:**

1. No exception handling around the main execution loop in `engine.py`
2. Inadequate error handling in LLM node's `run()` method
3. Missing error handling in LiteLLM client wrapper
4. Progress dialog not properly initialized, leading to potential null reference errors

**Solutions:**

#### A. Flow Engine (`engine.py`)

- Initialized `progress_dialog` early to avoid null reference issues
- Wrapped main execution loop in try-except with proper cleanup
- Added `execution_failed` flag to track execution state
- Added `finally` block to ensure progress dialog is always cleaned up
- Enhanced error messages with full exception logging
- Added critical error message box for user feedback

#### B. LLM Node (`llm_nodes.py`)

- Added outer try-except wrapper around entire `run()` method
- Enhanced exception logging with full stack traces
- Improved error messages for better debugging
- Added fallback handling when even warning dialogs fail

#### C. LiteLLM Client (`litellm_client.py`)

- Added comprehensive exception handling in `chat()` method
- Added detailed logging for API calls and responses
- Added specific handling for `AttributeError` (API compatibility issues)
- Added timeout and network error handling in `list_models_openrouter()`
- Wrapped everything in outer try-except to catch any unexpected errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Navigation:**

   - Try using arrow keys to pan the graph
   - Click the directional arrow buttons in the toolbar
   - Test zoom in/out and fit-to-view buttons
   - Hold spacebar and drag to pan (should still work)

2. **Test Flow Execution:**

   - Load the 5 LLM flow again
   - Set custom OpenRouter models
   - Run the flow
   - **Expected behavior:**
     - If API keys are invalid/missing: Clear error message, app stays open
     - If models are invalid: Clear error message, app stays open
     - If network fails: Clear error message, app stays open
     - Progress dialog should show node status and any errors
     - App should **never** crash silently

3. **Check Logs:**
   - Look for detailed error messages in the console
   - Stack traces will now be logged for all exceptions
   - LiteLLM calls are logged with model, base_url, and API key presence

## Files Modified

1. `aicodeprep_gui/pro/flow/flow_dock.py`

   - Added pan direction methods
   - Added zoom methods
   - Enhanced arrow key event filter
   - Added navigation buttons to toolbar

2. `aicodeprep_gui/pro/flow/engine.py`

   - Added comprehensive exception handling
   - Improved progress dialog initialization
   - Added execution state tracking
   - Enhanced error messages

3. `aicodeprep_gui/pro/flow/nodes/llm_nodes.py`

   - Added outer exception wrapper in `run()` method
   - Enhanced error logging
   - Improved error messages

4. `aicodeprep_gui/pro/llm/litellm_client.py`
   - Added comprehensive exception handling
   - Enhanced logging for debugging
   - Added network error handling

## Next Steps

1. Test the flow with valid OpenRouter API keys
2. Verify that error messages are clear and helpful
3. Check that the navigation controls work as expected
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

## Notes

- The app should now handle all errors gracefully without crashing
- All errors are logged with full stack traces for debugging
- User gets clear feedback about what went wrong
- Progress dialog properly tracks node execution status
