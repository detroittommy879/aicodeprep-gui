I spot a few odd things that will bite you at runtime or when you come back to this later:

1) Malformed HTML in your help file  
   In aicodeprep_gui/data/flow_studio_help.html you have
     ```html
     <pre>
     …Mac/Linux: ~/.aicodeprep-gui/api-keys.toml</pre
           >
     ```
   That stray newline between `</pre` and `>` makes it invalid HTML. It should be:
     ```html
     </pre>
     ```

2) Trailing newline in the GLM model ID  
   In your flow.json (and in load_template_best_of_5_configured) you configured
     `"model": "z-ai/glm-4.6\n"`
   That embedded `\n` will get stripped by `.strip()` in most places, but it’s confusing and could cause subtle bugs if any code skips the strip. Best to delete the trailing newline.

3) Your “Output Display” node is never hooked up  
   Both in flow.json and in load_template_best_of_5_configured you create an OutputDisplay node, but you never connect its `text` input to anything. As a result it’ll never show the Best-of-N result. You probably meant to do:
   ```python
   best_out = self._find_port(best, "text", "output")
   disp_in  = self._find_port(output_display, "text", "input")
   best_out.connect_to(disp_in)
   ```

4) That FileWrite node’s name is… overkill  
   In flow.json you gave it the name
   ```
   "File Write: best_of_n.txt: ..._of_all1.txt: ..._of_all1.txt"
   ```
   It’ll work, but it’s confusing in the UI. I’d simplify it to just “File Write” (and let its path property tell you where it writes).

Fix those three (well, four) things and you should have a working, self-documenting Best-of-5 flow.
