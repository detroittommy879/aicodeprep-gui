# Properties Panel Fix - October 5, 2025

## Problem Solved

The properties panel was not appearing because the `PropertiesBinWidget` class needs to be instantiated separately from the graph, not retrieved as an attribute.

## Root Cause

I was trying to call `graph.add_properties_bin()` to **create** the widget, but actually:

- `PropertiesBinWidget` is a **separate class** that needs to be imported
- It takes the `node_graph` as a constructor parameter
- Its constructor internally calls `node_graph.add_properties_bin(self)` to wire up signals

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Import PropertiesBinWidget

```python
from NodeGraphQt import NodeGraph, PropertiesBinWidget
```

### 2. Instantiate PropertiesBinWidget with Node Graph

```python
# Create the properties bin widget and pass the node graph
self.properties_bin = PropertiesBinWidget(node_graph=self.graph)
```

### 3. Optional: Connect Single-Click Handler

By default, `PropertiesBinWidget` only shows properties on **double-click**. Added single-click support:

```python
if hasattr(self.graph, 'node_selected'):
    self.graph.node_selected.connect(
        lambda node: self.properties_bin.add_node(node))
```

## How PropertiesBinWidget Works

According to NodeGraphQt documentation, `PropertiesBinWidget` automatically connects to these signals in its constructor:

1. **`node_double_clicked`**: Adds node to properties bin when double-clicked
2. **`nodes_deleted`**: Removes node from properties bin when deleted
3. **`property_changed`**: Updates property widgets when properties change via graph

The widget also calls `graph.add_properties_bin(self)` which registers it with the graph.

## Files Modified

**flow_dock.py:**

- Added `PropertiesBinWidget` import
- Changed from trying to retrieve `properties_bin` attribute to instantiating `PropertiesBinWidget`
- Simplified signal connection code (removed manual polling and callbacks)
- Added single-click handler for convenience

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart the application**
2. **Open Flow Studio** (Tools → Flow Studio)
3. **Click on any node** - properties should appear in the right panel immediately
4. **Double-click a node** - alternative way to show properties
5. **Edit properties** - changes should persist
6. **Click different nodes** - properties panel should update to show that node's properties

## Expected Behavior

### Properties Panel Should Display:

- **Node name** (editable)
- **Node type** (read-only label)
- **Properties tab** with all custom properties:
  - `path` for file nodes (with file browser button)
  - `provider`, `model_mode`, `api_key` for LLM nodes (dropdowns and text fields)
  - `extra_prompt` for BestOfN node (multiline text)
- **Ports tab** showing input/output connections
- **Node tab** with built-in properties (color, border, etc.)

### Interactions:

- ✅ Click node → properties appear
- ✅ Double-click node → properties appear (NodeGraphQt default)
- ✅ Edit text field → changes save on focus loss
- ✅ Select dropdown → changes save immediately
- ✅ Click file browser → open file dialog
- ✅ Close property editor → X button removes it from list
- ✅ Delete node → properties auto-removed

## Console Log Expectations

You should see:

```
✅ PropertiesBinWidget created successfully
✅ Connected node_selected to show properties on single click
✅ Properties panel added to layout
```

If you click nodes, you won't see polling messages anymore since the widget handles updates internally.

## Architecture Notes

### Why This Works

- `PropertiesBinWidget` is designed to be a **standalone widget** that manages its own state
- It maintains an internal list of property editor widgets (one per node)
- Signal connections are handled automatically in its `__init__`
- The widget has methods like `add_node()`, `remove_node()`, `clear_bin()`

### Widget Hierarchy

```
QDockWidget (FlowStudioDock)
└─ QWidget (wrapper)
   └─ QVBoxLayout
      ├─ QToolBar (toolbar)
      └─ QSplitter (horizontal)
         ├─ NodeGraphWidget (70%)
         └─ PropertiesBinWidget (30%)
            └─ QTableWidget (_prop_list)
               └─ NodePropEditorWidget (per node)
                  ├─ Name field
                  ├─ QTabWidget
                  │  ├─ Properties tab
                  │  ├─ Ports tab
                  │  └─ Node tab
                  └─ Type label
```

### Signal Flow

```
User clicks node
    ↓
graph.node_selected signal
    ↓
Lambda handler: properties_bin.add_node(node)
    ↓
PropertiesBinWidget creates NodePropEditorWidget
    ↓
Property widgets created from node.model properties
    ↓
Widgets displayed in properties panel
    ↓
User edits property
    ↓
Widget emits value_changed signal
    ↓
NodePropEditorWidget.property_changed signal
    ↓
PropertiesBinWidget.property_changed signal
    ↓
Graph updates node.model property
```

## Comparison to Previous Approach

### ❌ Previous (Incorrect)

```python
# Tried to retrieve widget from graph
self.properties_bin = self.graph.properties_bin  # Doesn't exist!
self.properties_bin = self.graph.add_properties_bin()  # Wrong! Takes widget as param
```

### ✅ Current (Correct)

```python
# Create widget separately and pass graph to it
self.properties_bin = PropertiesBinWidget(node_graph=self.graph)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Read the documentation examples carefully** - The GitHub examples showed the correct usage
2. **Check constructor signatures** - `PropertiesBinWidget(node_graph=...)` was the key
3. **Don't reinvent the wheel** - The widget already handles all the signal wiring
4. **Use MCP servers** - GitHub search via MCP provided the exact code examples needed

## Next Steps

Once verified working:

1. ✅ Test property editing and persistence
2. ✅ Verify file path browser works
3. ✅ Test LLM node property dropdowns
4. ✅ Verify flow execution uses edited properties
5. 🔄 Remove unused polling code (optional cleanup)
6. 📖 Update user documentation with property editing workflows
