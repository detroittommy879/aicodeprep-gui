First Launch
After installation, you can run the app two ways:

From any terminal: Type aicp and press Enter
With a specific folder: Type aicp /path/to/your/project
[Screenshot suggestion: Terminal showing the aicp command and the app launching]

Quick Start Tutorial
Let's get you making your first AI context in under 2 minutes:

Open your project: Navigate to any coding project folder and type aicp
Review the selection: The app automatically selects relevant files (_.py, _.js, README.md, etc.)
Add a question: Click any preset button or type in the prompt box
Generate: Click the big "GENERATE CONTEXT!" button
Paste: Your code + question is now copied to clipboard - paste it into any AI chat!

[Screenshot suggestion: Main interface with labeled sections]

Prompt Section (Bottom Half)

Preset Buttons: Quick-access to saved prompts
Text Box: Write custom questions for the AI
Clear Button: Empties the prompt box
Options Panel

Output Format: Choose between XML tags or Markdown formatting
Dark Mode: Toggle light/dark theme
Prompt Position: Add your question to top, bottom, or both
File Selection & Management
Smart Defaults
The app starts with intelligent file selection:

‚úÖ Code files (.py, .js, .ts, .html, etc.)
‚úÖ Documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
‚úÖ Config files (package.json, pyproject.toml)
‚ùå Dependencies (node_modules/, venv/)
‚ùå Build artifacts (dist/, build/)
‚ùå Binary files (images, executables)
Manual Selection
Individual Files: Check/uncheck any file
Folders: Checking a folder includes all files inside

Working with Prompts & Presets
Built-in Presets
The app comes with useful presets:

Debug: "Can you help me debug this code?"
Security Check: Analyzes for security issues
Best Practices: Reviews code quality and patterns
Cline Prompt: Formats requests for AI coding agents
[Screenshot suggestion: Preset buttons highlighted]

Creating Custom Presets
New Preset: Click the ‚úö button or go to Edit ‚Üí New Preset
Enter Label: Short name for your button
Add Text: The prompt text that gets inserted
Save: Available across all your projects!
Managing Presets
Delete: Click the üóëÔ∏è button to remove presets
Global: All presets are saved globally and work in any project
Prompt Positioning
Research shows asking questions before AND after code context improves AI responses:

Add to Top: ‚úÖ Question appears before your code
Add to Bottom: ‚úÖ Question appears after your code (default)
Both: ‚úÖ‚úÖ Maximum effectiveness (recommended!)
[Screenshot suggestion: Options panel showing the checkbox options]

Output Formats & Options
Format Choice
XML <code>: Wraps each file in <code> tags - great for most AIs
Markdown ###: Uses ### START OF FILE headers - cleaner for reading
Dark Mode
Auto-detect: Matches your system theme
Manual Toggle: Override with the checkbox
Persistent: Remembers your choice
Project Memory (.aicodeprep-gui files)
The app remembers your preferences per project:

File Selections: Which files you included/excluded
Window Size: Your preferred app dimensions
Panel Layout: Splitter position between file tree and prompt
The "Remember" Checkbox
‚úÖ Checked (default): Saves your choices to .aicodeprep-gui file
‚ùå Unchecked: Uses defaults each time (temporary session)
[Screenshot suggestion: Remember checkbox highlighted with tooltip visible]

üîß Integration & Workflows
Right-Click Context Menu Setup
For the ultimate workflow, add aicodeprep-gui to your file manager's right-click menu:

‚úÖ Enable classic menu (recommended for Windows 11)
Click Install - UAC prompt will appear
Right-click any folder ‚Üí "Open with aicodeprep-gui"!
[Screenshot suggestion: Windows right-click menu showing the option]

macOS Finder

IDE Integration Tips
VS Code / Cursor / Windsurf

# Open terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+`)

aicp

# When the agent is being difficult, use this for clean context!

Any IDE with Terminal
The beauty of aicodeprep-gui is it works alongside ANY editor:

Keep your IDE open
Open terminal in your project
Type aicp when you need clean AI context
Paste result into web-based AI for best results
AI Platform Workflows
Gemini 2.0 Flash / Pro (AI Studio) - Recommended
Why: Excellent with code, very fast, generous free tier
Paste: Direct paste works perfectly
Context: Handles large contexts well (2M+ tokens)
[Screenshot suggestion: AI Studio interface with pasted code context]

Deepseek Chat
Why: Amazing at coding tasks, very affordable
Best For: Complex debugging, architecture questions
Tip: Use "Best Practices" preset for code reviews
OpenRouter (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
Why: Access to ALL models in one place, lots of free options
Models: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and dozens more
Perfect For: Comparing different AI responses
OpenAI Playground
Why: Latest models (o1, o3), free playground credits
Best For: Complex reasoning tasks
Tip: Use XML format for better parsing
The Two-Step Workflow
For complex projects, try this powerful pattern:

Web AI (Step 1): Use aicodeprep-gui ‚Üí paste into Gemini/Claude

Get the smart solution/architecture/debug info
Clean context = better AI responses
IDE Agent (Step 2): Copy the solution ‚Üí paste into Cursor/Windsurf

Let the agent make the actual file changes
Use cheaper models for implementation
This gives you the best of both: smart problem-solving + efficient implementation!

‚ùì Help & Troubleshooting
Common Issues
"Command not found: aicp"
Solution: You need to open a fresh terminal after installation

Close all terminal/command windows
Open a new one
The PATH changes take effect in new sessions only
"No module named 'aicodeprep_gui'"
Solution: pipx installation issue

pipx reinstall aicodeprep-gui
App won't start / crashes immediately
Solutions:

Update to latest version: pipx upgrade aicodeprep-gui
Try debug mode: aicp --debug
Delete settings: aicp --delset (removes all saved preferences)
Right-click menu not appearing (Windows)
Solutions:

Run installer as Administrator
Restart Windows Explorer: Ctrl+Shift+Esc ‚Üí Find "Windows Explorer" ‚Üí Restart
Try the manual registry option in the installer dialog
Binary files showing as selected
Solution: This shouldn't happen, but if it does:

Click "Deselect All"
Click "Select All" - binary files will stay unselected
Or manually uncheck them
FAQ
Q: Do I need to install this in every project? A: No! Install once globally with pipx, then use aicp in any folder.

Q: What's the difference between aicp and aicodeprep-gui? A: Same program, aicp is just shorter to type.

Q: Can I use this with proprietary/private code? A: Yes! Everything runs locally, nothing is sent anywhere except when you paste into an AI.

Q: How do I update to the newest version? A: The app checks for updates automatically, or run: pipx upgrade aicodeprep-gui

Q: Can I exclude specific files permanently? A: Create an aicodeprep-gui.toml config file (see Configuration section), or just uncheck them - the app remembers per-project.
