Yes – you can completely avoid all the UI‐only fields (colors, positions, icons, etc.) by inventing your own tiny “flow DSL” that only cares about the semantics:

  • What nodes exist?  
  • What minimal properties each needs?  
  • How they hook together?

Below is one possible design.  Feel free to tweak it to your taste.

1) A toy grammar (indentation-based, like YAML)  

flow:  
  context: fullcode.txt                    ← “read this file + prompt”  
  models:                                 ← N parallel LLM calls  
    – name: LLM1  
      provider: openrouter  
      model: openai/gpt-5-codex  
      output: LLM1.md  
      temperature: 0.7  
    – name: LLM2  
      provider: openrouter  
      model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5  
      output: LLM2.md  
      temperature: 0.7  
    – name: LLM3  
      provider: openrouter  
      model: z-ai/glm-4.6  
      output: LLM3.md  
      temperature: 0.7  
    – name: LLM4  
      provider: openrouter  
      model: qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking  
      output: LLM4.md  
      temperature: 0.7  
    – name: LLM5  
      provider: openrouter  
      model: openai/o4-mini  
      output: LLM5.md  
      temperature: 0.7  
  synth:                                   ← Best-of-N aggregator  
    type: best-of  
    of: 5  
    model: google/gemini-2.5-pro  
    extra-prompt: |  
      You are an expert coder …  
  outputs:                                 ← where the final “best” goes  
    – clipboard  
    – file: best_of_all1.txt  
    – display  

2) What it means, in English  

  • “context” is a single node that emits the text of `fullcode.txt`.  
  • Under “models” you declare N identical LLM nodes (name, provider, model id, temperature, and where to dump each model’s raw answer).  
  • “synth” is your Best-of-N node: it takes the original context plus all N model outputs, and synthesizes them with another model.  
  • “outputs” is just a list of downstream I/O nodes.

3) How simple it is to write  

  – No GUIDs  
  – No coordinates  
  – No color arrays  
  – No “type_” strings – you infer the node‐class from the block key (`context`, `models`, `synth`, `outputs`)  
  – No explicit “connections” list: by convention  
     * context ⇒ every `models[i]`  
     * context ⇒ `synth.context`  
     * models[i] ⇒ `synth.candidate[i]`  
     * synth ⇒ every `outputs[j]`

4) Turning it into the JSON your app expects  

You write a tiny script (Python, JS, whatever) to:

  1. Parse the DSL (it’s almost YAML).  
  2. Instantiate one ContextOutputNode, N OpenRouterNodes, one BestOfNNode, and the requested Clipboard/FileWrite/Display nodes.  
  3. Auto-wire the ports by the conventions above.  
  4. Dump the full JSON structure.

That way you keep your flow definitions razor-thin, human-editable, and auto-expandable back into the heavyweight GUI JSON whenever you need to load them in Flow Studio.
