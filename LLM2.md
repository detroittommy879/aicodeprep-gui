This is a **very common issue** with Python packages, especially those that rely on external libraries or frameworks like `NodeGraphQt`. The fact that `NodeGraphQt` is not found on other machines, even though you've included it in `pyproject.toml`, points to a fundamental misunderstanding of how Python package dependencies and installation work.

Here's the core problem and how to fix it:

---

## ❌ The Core Issue

You are **not** installing `NodeGraphQt` as a dependency for your package.

You have this in your `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
dependencies = [
    "PySide6>=6.9,<6.10",
    "toml",
    "NodeGraphQt",  # ← This is the problem
    "pathspec",
    "requests",
    "packaging",
    "Pygments>=2.18.0",
    "litellm>=1.40.0"
]
```

However, **this line `NodeGraphQt` does NOT mean `NodeGraphQt` will be installed when someone installs your package**. `pyproject.toml` (and `requirements.txt`) are only for **runtime dependencies** — they tell the user: “If you install my package, you need these other packages too.”

But **`NodeGraphQt` is not a standard Python package** — it's a **custom, non-standard library** that you're using in your codebase.

The problem is: **Your package depends on a library that is not available on PyPI** — or, more likely, the library is not published under the same name, or is not discoverable by pip, or is a local package you're not publishing correctly.

---

## ✅ The Real Problem

Looking at your code and `pyproject.toml`, you're trying to use `NodeGraphQt` — which is not a standard Python package. It's likely a **custom library** you've built or a third-party library you're using locally. This is **not published on PyPI**, so when someone installs your package, it doesn’t know to install `NodeGraphQt` from PyPI — it’s not there.

---

## ✅ The Correct Fix

### ✅ 1. **Publish `NodeGraphQt` as a separate package on PyPI**

If `NodeGraphQt` is a library you wrote or someone else wrote, you need to publish it as its own package on PyPI.

Steps:

1. Create a `NodeGraphQt` package with its own `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, and proper structure (including `README.md`, `LICENSE`, etc.).
2. Upload it to PyPI using `twine upload dist/*`.
3. Then, in your `aicodeprep-gui` `pyproject.toml`, reference it as a dependency with the correct version.

Example:
```toml
dependencies = [
    "PySide6>=6.9,<6.10",
    "toml",
    "NodeGraphQt>=1.2.0",  # ← Now points to your published version
    "pathspec",
    "requests",
    "packaging",
    "Pygments>=2.18.0",
    "litellm>=1.40.0"
]
```

If `NodeGraphQt` is not published, then you cannot use it as a dependency — you must ship it with your package.

---

### ✅ 2. **Ship `NodeGraphQt` as part of your package (Embed it)**

If you want to use `NodeGraphQt` in your package and you don’t want to publish it separately, you must include it as a **submodule** or **embedded package**.

This is the most reliable way to ensure your package works everywhere.

Here’s how to do it:

#### ➤ 1. Add `NodeGraphQt` as a submodule in your package

Structure:
```
aicodeprep-gui/
├── setup.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── data/
├── images/
├── pro/
├── NodeGraphQt/  ← This is your embedded package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── ...
└── main.py
```

Then in `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`, you must tell pip to include it.

In `pyproject.toml`, you can do this:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
nodegraphqt = [
    "NodeGraphQt==1.2.0"  # ← Or use a relative path if it's embedded
]
```

Then, in your `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`, you must specify that `NodeGraphQt` is a **subdirectory**.

In `pyproject.toml`, you can do this:

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-data]
aicodeprep-gui = [
    "NodeGraphQt/**/*"
]
```

#### ➤ 2. In `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`, include `NodeGraphQt` as a package

In `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="aicodeprep-gui",
    version="1.2.2",
    packages=find_packages(include=["aicodeprep-gui", "aicodeprep-gui.*", "NodeGraphQt"]),  # ← Include NodeGraphQt
    install_requires=[
        "PySide6>=6.9,<6.10",
        "toml",
        "pathspec",
        "requests",
        "packaging",
        "Pygments>=2.18.0",
        "litellm>=1.40.0"
    ],
    # ... other setup options ...
)
```

#### ➤ 3. In your package’s `__init__.py`, import `NodeGraphQt`

In your `aicodeprep-gui/__init__.py`:

```python
from . import NodeGraphQt  # ← Import NodeGraphQt as a module

__all__ = ["NodeGraphQt"]
```

Then in your code, you can use it like:

```python
from aicodeprep_gui import NodeGraphQt
# Now use NodeGraphQt
```

---

## ✅ 3. **Use a Virtual Environment or Docker (Optional but Recommended)**

If you’re distributing your package, the safest way to ensure all dependencies are available is to use a **Docker image** or **virtual environment** with a `requirements.txt`.

But that’s not necessary for your use case — the key is ensuring that `NodeGraphQt` is either:

- Published on PyPI and installed as a dependency, or
- Embedded in your package as a submodule.

---

## ✅ 4. **Alternative: Use `requirements.txt` (Not Recommended for Production)**

You can temporarily use `requirements.txt` for development:

```txt
PySide6>=6.9,<6.10
toml
NodeGraphQt
pathspec
requests
packaging
Pygments>=2.18.0
litellm>=1.40.0
```

But this is not a good practice for production. It's only for development or testing.

---

## ✅ 5. **Check Your `pyproject.toml`**

Make sure you’re not accidentally using `NodeGraphQt` as a **development dependency**.

In `pyproject.toml`, make sure you’re not using `dev-dependencies`:

```toml
[tool.setuptools.package-data]
aicodeprep-gui = [
    "NodeGraphQt/**/*"
]
```

If you’re using `dev-dependencies`, it won’t be installed when someone installs your package.

---

## ✅ 6. **Debug by Trying to Import `NodeGraphQt` Manually**

Open a Python shell and try to import `NodeGraphQt`:

```python
from aicodeprep_gui import NodeGraphQt
```

If it fails with `ModuleNotFoundError`, then you’re not installing the package correctly.

If it works, then you’re good to go.

---

## ✅ 7. **Use `pip install -e .` to Test Installation**

After installing your package locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Then try to import `NodeGraphQt` in your code.

If it works, then you’re good to go.

---

## ✅ 8. **Use `pyproject.toml` with `build-system`**

Make sure your `pyproject.toml` has the correct build system:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

This is important for modern Python projects.

---

## ✅ 9. **Check Your `setup.py` (If You’re Using It)**

If you’re using `setup.py`, make sure you’re not missing the `find_packages` or `install_requires`.

Example `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="aicodeprep-gui",
    version="1.2.2",
    packages=find_packages(include=["aicodeprep-gui", "aicodeprep-gui.*", "NodeGraphQt"]),
    install_requires=[
        "PySide6>=6.9,<6.10",
        "toml",
        "pathspec",
        "requests",
        "packaging",
        "Pygments>=2.18.0",
        "litellm>=1.40.0",
    ],
    # ... other setup options ...
)
```

---

## ✅ 10. **Fix Your `pyproject.toml` to Include `NodeGraphQt`**

In `pyproject.toml`, make sure you’re including `NodeGraphQt` as a dependency:

```toml
[project.dependencies]
PySide6>=6.9,<6.10
toml
pathspec
requests
packaging
Pygments>=2.18.0
litellm>=1.40.0
NodeGraphQt>=1.2.0
```

---

## ✅ 11. **Use `pip install .` to Test**

After installing your package locally:

```bash
pip install .
```

Then try to import `NodeGraphQt` in your code.

If it works, then you’re good to go.
