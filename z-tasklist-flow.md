tasks to do:
this is for flow studio mainly

1. The hand button or spacebar, and also those arrows still don't work.. they are supposed to let the user move the flow graph thing around. The mouse does make it zoom in and out but there isn't any way to freely move the whole thing. The fit button works though. I have tried to fix it before but failed.

---- test first before going to 2, just stop here so i can test it

2. add some section so users can drag and drop or push to add nodes for LLMs, file output, clipboard, etc and also a new node for them to add new
   types of LLMs with custom endpoints, custom api keys, so they can add other providers besides openrouter. Add some built in ones like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini/google, and each of those will have their own api key section in the api-keys file, and for the OpenAI compatible they should be allowed to add as
   many as they want each with their own endpoints/api keys, you could just number them like open ai compatible 1, 2, 3.. etc or appreviate it maybe.

Ah! That's the issue - when you enable pan mode, it's still in RubberBandDrag mode (which creates the selection square) instead of actually enabling the hand drag. Let me look at the NodeGraphQt documentation and check what method we should really be using:

Searched text for pan|drag|hand|scroll|viewer (\*\*/ng.md), 50 results
Read flow_dock.py, lines 860 to 940

I see from the ng.md that the default behavior is Alt + LMB + Drag or MMB + Drag for panning. The issue is that \_set_viewer_pan might not be working as expected. Let me check if there's more information about how NodeGraphQt handles panning:

Searched text for ALT_state (\*\*/ng.md), no results

Searched codebase for "NodeViewer ALT_state LMB_state pan mode drag mode viewer state", 13 results
I see! The viewer has ALT_state and LMB_state properties. According to the ng.md docs, NodeGraphQt's default pan behavior is Alt + LMB + Drag. The issue is that we're trying to toggle modes, but NodeGraphQt might be handling pan through Alt key state detection instead. Let me check if we need to simulate the ALT state instead:

flow_dock.py+51-49
Perfect! Now I've updated the code to use NodeGraphQt's ALT_state property, which is how NodeGraphQt actually detects whether to enable panning. According to the documentation, NodeGraphQt uses Alt + LMB + Drag for panning, which means it checks the ALT_state flag internally.

Now when you:

Click the hand button (âœ‹): It sets ALT_state = True, making left mouse button dragging act as panning
Hold spacebar: It temporarily sets ALT_state = True while held
Release or uncheck: It sets ALT_state = False, restoring normal selection behavior
This should fix the issue where it was showing the rubber band selection square instead of panning. The viewer will now properly recognize that it should pan when you drag with the left mouse button.

Please test it now: Enable Flow Studio, click the hand button, and try dragging with the left mouse button - it should now pan the canvas instead of creating a selection rectangle!
