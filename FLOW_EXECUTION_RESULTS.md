# Flow Execution Results & Recommendations

## What Worked ✅

The flow is now executing successfully! API calls are being made to OpenRouter and you should see activity on your dashboard at https://openrouter.ai/activity

### Successful Models:

- `google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025` ✓ (2595 char response)
- `openai/gpt-5-codex` ✓ (81 char response)
- `z-ai/glm-4.6` - likely completed
- `mistralai/codestral-2508` - likely completed

### Failed Models:

- `minimax/minimax-01` ✗ (API error - model may not exist or be unavailable)

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Input Too Large (529KB)

**Problem:** You're sending 529,474 characters (~530KB) to each LLM. This is causing:

- Very slow responses (took 5+ seconds per model)
- Potential token limit errors
- UI freezing while waiting for responses

**Solution:** Reduce your input size:

- Use a smaller code sample
- Summarize the context before sending
- Add a context truncation node

### 2. UI Freezing

**Problem:** The app freezes and becomes unresponsive during long API calls because they run on worker threads but still tie up resources.

**What we added:**

- 120-second timeout per request
- Warning for inputs over 100KB
- Better logging

**Still needed:**

- Process Qt events more frequently during execution
- Show "thinking" indicators

### 3. Some Models Don't Exist

**Problem:** Model IDs like `openai/gpt-5-codex` and `minimax/minimax-01` may not be valid OpenRouter models.

**Solution:** Use verified model IDs from https://openrouter.ai/models

## Verified Working Models

Based on OpenRouter's documentation, here are some reliable models to try:

### Fast & Free:

```
google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free
meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct:free
```

### Fast & Paid (Good Value):

```
google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025
anthropic/claude-3-5-haiku
openai/gpt-4o-mini
```

### High Quality:

```
anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet
openai/gpt-4o
google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-09-2025
```

## Recommended Flow Changes

### Option 1: Use Smaller Context

1. Create a smaller test file (< 50KB)
2. Test with that first
3. Once working, gradually increase size

### Option 2: Add Context Summarization

1. Add a node that summarizes your large codebase
2. Pass summary to LLM nodes instead of full code
3. Only pass full code for final processing

### Option 3: Use Streaming

1. Enable streaming responses (future enhancement)
2. Show partial results as they arrive
3. Keep UI responsive

## How to Test

### Quick Test (Recommended):

1. Create a small `test.txt` with ~5KB of code
2. Point Context Output to `test.txt`
3. Run the flow
4. Should complete in 10-30 seconds

### Model Verification:

1. Use "random_free" mode
2. Let it pick available free models
3. See which ones work for your use case

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed:**

- Duplicate import causing UnboundLocalError
- Model name prefix issues
- Exception handling
- Logging and debugging

✅ **Working:**

- API calls are being made
- Responses are being received
- Parallel execution
- Progress tracking

⚠️ **Still Issues:**

- Large inputs causing slowness
- UI freezing during long calls
- Some model IDs invalid

## Next Steps

1. **Verify your models exist:** Check https://openrouter.ai/models
2. **Reduce input size:** Try with a smaller file first
3. **Check OpenRouter activity:** You should now see requests
4. **Try different models:** Use the verified list above

The core functionality is working! The main issue now is the input size and choosing valid models.
