# Flow Configured Template Fix - October 14, 2025

## Issue

The "Load Built-in: Best-of-5 (Configured)" option was not working properly. It was attempting to load the `data/flow.json` file through the JSON import mechanism, which was failing due to serialization issues. Meanwhile, the blank version and manual file loading were working fine.

## Root Cause

The function `load_template_best_of_5_configured()` was trying to:

1. Extract `flow.json` from package resources
2. Write it to a temp file
3. Use `import_from_json()` to load it

However, this approach was encountering JSON deserialization errors in the NodeGraphQt library where it expected strings but was receiving dict objects.

## Solution

Instead of trying to load the JSON file directly, the fix programmatically creates all nodes with the exact configurations from `data/flow.json`. This approach:

1. **Clears the graph** - Removes any existing nodes
2. **Creates nodes programmatically** - Uses the same `_create_node_compat()` method as the blank version
3. **Sets all properties** - Configures each node with the values from flow.json:
   - Context Output node with path "fullcode.txt"
   - 5 OpenRouter LLM nodes with specific models:
     - GPT-5 Codex (openai/gpt-5-codex)
     - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5)
     - GLM-4.6 (z-ai/glm-4.6)
     - Qwen3 Next 80B (qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking)
     - O4-Mini (openai/o4-mini)
   - Best-of-N Synthesizer with Gemini 2.5 Pro and custom synthesis prompt
   - Clipboard node
   - FileWrite node outputting to "best_of_all1.txt"
   - OutputDisplay node
4. **Wires all connections** - Connects all the nodes properly
5. **Re-registers nodes** - Updates the properties panel

## Changes Made

### File: `aicodeprep_gui/pro/flow/flow_dock.py`

**Function Modified:** `load_template_best_of_5_configured()`

- Removed the JSON file loading and import logic
- Added programmatic node creation with exact configurations from flow.json
- Added proper node property setting for all 5 LLM models
- Added the detailed Best-of-N synthesis prompt
- Added all necessary connections between nodes
- Improved error handling and logging

## Testing Results

The application was tested and the logs confirm:

```

```

All connections were established successfully, and the success message box appeared.

## Benefits

1. **Reliability** - No longer depends on JSON file parsing which was causing issues
2. **Consistency** - Uses the same node creation method as the blank template
3. **Maintainability** - Code is clearer and easier to modify if configurations need to change
4. **Robustness** - Avoids JSON serialization issues in NodeGraphQt
5. **User Experience** - The configured template now works perfectly alongside the blank template

## User Impact

Users can now successfully use the "Load Built-in: Best-of-5 (Configured)" option to instantly load a fully configured 5-LLM flow with:

- Pre-selected top-tier AI models
- Professional Best-of-N synthesis configuration
- Ready-to-run setup (just add OpenRouter API key)
- Proper file outputs and clipboard integration

This matches the functionality of manually loading `data/flow.json` but with better reliability and user experience.
