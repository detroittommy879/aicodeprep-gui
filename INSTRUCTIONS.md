---

## ★ Windows Installation

### Easiest Method (Recommended)

1.  **Install Python:** Double-click the included Python installer file (e.g., `python-3.13.5-amd64.exe`).
    - **IMPORTANT:** In the first screen of the Python installer, make sure to check the box at the bottom that says **"Add python.exe to PATH"**.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
2.  **Install the App:** Once Python is installed, simply double-click the `INSTALLER_Windows.bat` script. A command window will open, show the installation progress, and close when finished.

### Manual Method (Advanced)

If you prefer to install using the command line:

1.  **Install Python:** Follow step 1 from the "Easiest Method" above, ensuring you add Python to your PATH.
2.  **Open a Fresh Terminal:** Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window. **Do not reuse an old one.**
3.  **Install `pipx`:** This tool installs Python applications in a clean, isolated environment.
    ```shell
    py -m pip install --user pipx
    ```
4.  **Add `pipx` to your PATH:** This makes sure you can run `pipx` commands from anywhere.
    ```shell
    py -m pipx ensurepath
    ```
5.  **Open another Fresh Terminal:** Close your current terminal and open a new one to ensure the PATH changes are loaded.
6.  **Install `aicodeprep-gui`:**
    ```shell
    pipx install aicodeprep-gui
    ```

## ★ macOS Installation

### Easiest Method (Recommended)

Simply double-click the `INSTALLER_MacOS.sh` script. Your Mac may ask for permission to run it. The script will handle installing dependencies (like Homebrew and `pipx`) and the application itself.

### Manual Method (Advanced)

1.  **Install Homebrew:** If you don't have it, open Terminal and run:
    ```shell
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```
2.  **Install `pipx`:**
    ```shell
    brew install pipx
    ```
3.  **Add `pipx` to your PATH:**
    ```shell
    pipx ensurepath
    ```
4.  **Open a Fresh Terminal:** Close the current Terminal window and open a new one.
5.  **Install `aicodeprep-gui`:**
    ```shell
    pipx install aicodeprep-gui
    ```

## ★ Linux Installation

### Easiest Method (Recommended)

1.  Open a terminal in the directory where you extracted these files.
2.  Make the installer script executable:
    ```shell
    chmod +x INSTALLER_Linux.sh
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```shell
    ./INSTALLER_Linux.sh
    ```
    The script will detect your distribution's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`) and ask for your password to install dependencies like `python3-pip` if they are missing.

### Manual Method (Advanced)

1.  **Install Python and Pip:** Use your distribution's package manager.
    - **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y`
    - **Fedora:** `sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip -y`
    - **Arch:** `sudo pacman -Syu python python-pip --noconfirm`
2.  **Install `pipx`:**
    ```shell
    python3 -m pip install --user pipx
    ```
3.  **Add `pipx` to your PATH:**
    ```shell
    python3 -m pipx ensurepath
    ```
4.  **Open a Fresh Terminal:** Close your current terminal and open a new one.
5.  **Install `aicodeprep-gui`:**
    ```shell
    pipx install aicodeprep-gui
    ```

## ✔ After Installation: Running the App

After a successful installation, you **must open a new terminal window**.

You can now run the app from any folder on your system by opening a terminal in that folder and typing:

```shell
aicp
```

...or the longer command `aicodeprep-gui`.

## ✔ Add Right-Click "Open With..." Functionality (Optional, but awesome!)

For the best experience, add the right-click context menu to your file manager.

- **Windows:**

  1.  Run the app (`aicp`).
  2.  In the application's menu bar, go to `File` -> `Install Right-Click Menu...`.
  3.  Follow the on-screen instructions. A UAC prompt will appear, as this requires administrator privileges to modify the registry.

- **macOS:**

  1.  After successfully installing the application, find the `AICodePrep.workflow` file that was included with your download.
  2.  **Double-click `AICodePrep.workflow`**.
  3.  A dialog will appear asking if you want to install the "AICodePrep" Quick Action. Click **Install**.
  4.  You can now right-click any folder in Finder and find the action under the **Quick Actions** menu.
      _(Note: The `File` menu option inside the app does not currently work for this on macOS, so you must double-click the `.workflow` file.)_

- **Linux (Nautilus File Manager):**

  1.  This feature is designed for the Nautilus file manager, which is default on GNOME, Ubuntu, and Cinnamon desktops.
  2.  Run the app (`aicp`).
  3.  In the application's menu bar, go to `File` -> `Install File Manager Action...`.
  4.  Use the "Install Nautilus Script" button.
  5.  You may need to restart Nautilus (`nautilus -q`) or log out and back in for the script to appear in your right-click menu.

- **Linux (Other File Managers):**
  If you use a different file manager (like Dolphin, Thunar, etc.), the automated installer might not work. However, you can likely add a custom action manually. Ask an AI assistant for help! For example, you could ask:
  > "How do I add a custom right-click action to the Thunar file manager on XFCE that runs the command `aicp %f` on a selected folder?"
