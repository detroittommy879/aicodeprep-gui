### 💡 Seeking Feedback: The Future of AI Code Prep GUI (New & Premium Feature Ideas)

Hey!

I’ve been gradually improving **AI Code Prep GUI** and wanted to share some feature ideas to get your feedback. I'm planning both core additions and potential premium upgrades, and I'd love to hear what you'd find most useful—whether you're a current user or just curious about the project.

Your input is super valuable in shaping the direction of the tool!

### 🆓 Planned Free Improvements

These are enhancements I want to make available for everyone to improve the core experience.

- **🌐 Accessibility: Internationalization & Localization**
  Self explanatory. Colorblind colors, Any suggestions welcome!

- **⚡ Performance & Caching**
  A smarter engine that detects only changed files to avoid reprocessing everything, plus a potential Go-based translation layer for blazing-fast context generation.

- **📘 Quickstart Tutorial**
  A short, guided walkthrough on first launch, which can also be accessed later from the menu.

- **🧠 "Why This Works": Better Explanations & Proof**
  Clear, repeatable examples demonstrating why this workflow gets better results from AI models. We'll show testable comparisons so the benefits are obvious.

- **🤖 Highlight some Specific Workflows**
  Highlighting some specific workflows, like using **GPT-4.1 as a "refining agent with Cline"** For example, a flow where you get raw output from the best web chat models and then have GPT-4.1 automatically clean it up while auto editing files can often produce superior results.

### 💎 Ideas for features

- **💀 Skeleton Modes**
  Multiple modes to intelligently compress folders, files, or even entire code sections while still providing some context. I could have more than just checkmarks, like right click for skeleton instead with a different color or symbol.

  Example of a "skeleton" output:

  ```markdown
  ### These files/folders exist but the contents were skipped

  /fried/Potatoes.md
  /fried/test/
  /fried/Soups.py

  ### END of Skipped
  ```

- **🧠Context Packer Engine with several modes and granular control**
  System designed to intelligently compress parts of massive codebases, making it possible to feed huge projects into models without letting some agent guess at it.

- **🔐 Secrets & API Key Detection & Blocking**
  Automatically scan for and offer to block API keys, passwords, and other secrets to prevent accidental exposure.

- **🪟 Live Preview Panel**
  An optional side-panel that shows you the exact code and prompt context being prepared in real-time.

- **🔁 Wuu73 API Router**
  An in-house proxy service to route requests across multiple API providers, helping you maximize free-tier usage and find the best model for the job.

- **📚 Guides & Cheatsheets**
  A collection of tips, tutorials, and resources. Examples include:

  - How to use this tool and the info to be able to code better than using all the shiny new expensive stuff. How to not fall for all the COOL LOOKING but not necessarily great stuff out there

- **🎨 Full UI Customization**
  Unlock themes, custom fonts, colors. It can be important for the tools we use daily to be pleasant to look at.

- **📋 A "Clipboard Helper"** (OS-level app or browser extension) to automatically paste context into web chats like Gemini, ChatGPT, etc and cut and paste back.

- **👥 A "Panel of Experts Problem Solver Mode"** that sends a query to multiple models, then compares answers to help you pick the best one. When I do this manually it usually finds a fix for a problem.

- **🗣️ "AI Experts Simulation"** modes that simulate a discussion between multiple AI agents to arrive at a more robust solution.

### 👇 Your Feedback is Needed!

I'd love to hear your thoughts on any or all of this:

- **Which of these features should get priority?**
- **Is there anything you feel is missing from this list?**

Thanks again to everyone who has tried the tool and provided feedback so far!
