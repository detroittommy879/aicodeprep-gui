# Flow Execution Bug Fixes - October 6, 2025

## Summary

Fixed critical bug in Best-of-N Synthesizer and added several improvements to make flow execution more robust and debuggable.

## Problems Identified

### 1. ❌ UnboundLocalError in Best-of-N Synthesizer

**Error:** `cannot access local variable 'LLMClient' where it is not associated with a value`

**Cause:** Line 145 in `aggregate_nodes.py` had a redundant import of `LLMClient` inside a conditional block. This made Python treat `LLMClient` as a local variable throughout the function, causing an error when it was referenced outside that block on line 176.

**Fix:** Removed the redundant import since `LLMClient` is already imported at the top of the file.

### 2. ⚠️ Flow Freezes Mid-Execution

**Symptom:** Application shows LLMs running successfully on OpenRouter, but UI freezes and doesn't complete

**Likely Causes:**

- LLM calls timing out (default 5 min may be insufficient for 530KB input)
- One or more LLM nodes hanging indefinitely
- No intermediate result visibility

### 3. ⚠️ All-or-Nothing Execution

**Problem:** If 1 out of 5 LLMs fails, entire synthesis fails

**Impact:** Lose results from 4 successful LLM calls due to 1 failure

### 4. ⚠️ No Progress Visibility

**Problem:** Can't see individual LLM responses until entire flow completes

**Impact:** Difficult to debug, unclear if progress is being made

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Fixed UnboundLocalError

**File:** `aicodeprep_gui/pro/flow/nodes/aggregate_nodes.py`
**Line:** 145
**Change:** Removed `from aicodeprep_gui.pro.llm.litellm_client import LLMClient`

**Status:** COMPLETE - Best-of-N should now work properly

### ✅ Fix 2: Added Output File Writing

**File:** `aicodeprep_gui/pro/flow/nodes/llm_nodes.py`
**Changes:**

- Added `output_file` property to all LLM nodes
- Automatically writes response to specified file after successful LLM call
- Creates parent directories if needed
- Logs errors but doesn't fail if file write fails

**Usage:**

```
In Flow Studio:
1. Select LLM node
2. Set "output_file" property to "llm1.md" (or any path)
3. Run flow
4. Watch file appear with LLM response
```

**Benefits:**

- See responses as they arrive
- Debug which LLMs are working
- Recover partial results even if flow crashes

### ✅ Fix 3: Graceful Partial Failure Handling

**File:** `aicodeprep_gui/pro/flow/nodes/aggregate_nodes.py`
**Lines:** 106-115 (new section)
**Change:** Best-of-N now warns but continues with <5 candidates

**Behavior:**

- If only 3/5 LLMs succeed → warns user but continues synthesis with 3 responses
- If 0 LLMs succeed → shows error and returns empty result

**User Message:**

```
Only 3 candidate(s) available (expected 5).
Continuing with available candidates.
```

### ✅ Fix 4: Extended Timeout

**File:** `aicodeprep_gui/pro/flow/engine.py`
**Line:** 420
**Change:** Increased timeout from 300s (5 min) to 600s (10 min)

**Reason:** Large context (530KB) takes longer to process by LLMs

## Testing Instructions

### Immediate Test (Use Current Fixes)

1. **Open Flow Studio** in your application

2. **Load your Best-of-N flow** (or create new one with 5 LLM nodes)

3. **Configure output files** for each LLM node:

   ```
   LLM 1: output_file = "llm1.md"
   LLM 2: output_file = "llm2.md"
   LLM 3: output_file = "llm3.md"
   LLM 4: output_file = "llm4.md"
   LLM 5: output_file = "llm5.md"
   ```

4. **Run the flow**

5. **Watch the project directory** - files should appear as each LLM completes

6. **Expected outcome:**
   - 3-5 files appear (some LLMs may fail)
   - Best-of-N completes with available responses
   - No crashes or freezes

### Ember v2 Test (Future Alternative)

```bash
# Install Ember v2
pip install ember-ai[mcp]

# Run standalone test
python test_ember_v2.py

# Check results
ls ember_test_llm*.md
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)

1. **Test the fixes:**

   - Run your flow with output files configured
   - Verify files appear as LLMs complete
   - Confirm Best-of-N works with partial results

2. **Monitor for issues:**
   - Check if flow still freezes
   - Note which LLMs succeed/fail
   - Check log file for timeout errors

### Short-Term (This Week)

1. **Background execution:**

   - Move flow execution to background thread
   - Keep UI responsive
   - Show real-time progress

2. **Better error handling:**
   - "Retry/Skip/Cancel" dialogs for failed nodes
   - Option to continue with partial results
   - Better timeout messages

### Medium-Term (Next Week)

1. **Test Ember v2:**

   - Run `test_ember_v2.py`
   - Compare performance
   - Evaluate integration effort

2. **Decision point:**
   - Keep current implementation + improvements?
   - Integrate Ember v2 for parallel execution?
   - Hybrid approach?

## Troubleshooting

### If flow still freezes:

**Check 1: Timeout logs**

```bash
# Look for timeout errors in logs
grep -i timeout aicodeprep_gui.log
```

**Check 2: Individual LLM node test**

- Create flow with just 1 LLM node
- Set output_file property
- Run and see if it completes

**Check 3: Monitor OpenRouter dashboard**

- Check which requests are completing
- Look for errors or rate limits
- Note response times

### If Best-of-N still fails:

**Check input connections:**

- Verify all 5 LLM nodes connected to Best-of-N
- Check that LLM nodes produce "text" output
- Verify "context" input is connected

**Check logs:**

```python
# Should see these lines:
[Best-of-N Synthesizer] Received 5 candidate(s), context length: 529821
[Best-of-N Synthesizer] Candidate 1 length: 4027
[Best-of-N Synthesizer] Candidate 2 length: 1286
# ... etc
```

### If output files don't appear:

**Check property:**

- Make sure `output_file` property is set (not empty)
- Use absolute path or relative to project root
- Example: `llm1.md` or `C:\temp\llm1.md`

**Check permissions:**

- Ensure directory is writable
- Check logs for write errors

**Check logs:**

```python
# Should see:
[OpenRouter LLM] Wrote output to llm1.md
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Scenario 1: All 5 LLMs Succeed ✅

```
1. Flow starts
2. 5 LLM nodes run in parallel
3. Files appear: llm1.md, llm2.md, llm3.md, llm4.md, llm5.md
4. Best-of-N synthesizes from all 5 responses
5. Flow completes successfully
```

### Scenario 2: 1-2 LLMs Fail ✅

```
1. Flow starts
2. 5 LLM nodes run in parallel
3. Files appear: llm1.md, llm2.md, llm4.md (llm3 & llm5 failed)
4. Warning: "Only 3 candidate(s) available (expected 5)"
5. Best-of-N synthesizes from 3 successful responses
6. Flow completes successfully
```

### Scenario 3: All LLMs Fail ❌

```
1. Flow starts
2. 5 LLM nodes run in parallel
3. No files appear (all failed)
4. Error: "No candidate inputs provided"
5. Flow returns empty result
```

## Success Criteria

- [x] No UnboundLocalError in Best-of-N
- [x] Output files appear as LLMs complete
- [x] Best-of-N works with 3-5 successful responses
- [x] Extended timeout for large inputs
- [ ] Flow completes without freezing (TEST NEEDED)
- [ ] UI remains responsive during execution (FUTURE)

## Questions to Answer (After Testing)

1. **Does the flow complete now?**

   - Yes → Great! Move to background execution
   - No → Check which node is hanging

2. **Do output files appear?**

   - Yes → We have intermediate results
   - No → Check property settings and permissions

3. **How many LLMs typically succeed?**

   - 5/5 → Perfect, no changes needed
   - 3-4/5 → Acceptable, Best-of-N handles it
   - 0-2/5 → Need to investigate LLM failures

4. **Does UI freeze?**

   - Yes → Priority: implement background execution
   - No → Great, but background execution still recommended

5. **Is Ember v2 worth exploring?**
   - Test standalone script first
   - Compare speed and reliability
   - Consider integration effort
