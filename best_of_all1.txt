This is a test case to verify the system's ability to follow instructions. The prompt is "test - just say test passed", which requires a specific literal response, not an analysis of the provided code.

### Analysis of Candidate Solutions

*   **Candidate 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:**
    *   **Strengths:** All candidates correctly identified the prompt as a direct instruction and provided the exact required output, "test passed". This demonstrates perfect adherence to the user's request.
    *   **Weaknesses:** None. For this specific task, there is no other correct answer or room for improvement.

### Synthesized 'Best of All' Solution

The user's prompt is a simple directive. All candidate solutions correctly followed this directive. Synthesizing a "best of all" solution in this context means reaffirming the correctness of the candidates' approach and providing the requested output. The provided code files are irrelevant to this specific task, which serves as a control test.

The best and only correct response is the one explicitly requested.

test passed
