# BestOfNNode Dynamic Slots - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Changed

The BestOfNNode now has a **`num_candidates` spinner control** that lets you specify how many candidate slots (1-10) to use. No more unused slots visible!

---

## 🎛️ How to Use It

### 1. **Load a Template**

```
Flow Menu → Load Built-in: Best-of-3 (Configured)
                          OR
           → Load Built-in: Best-of-5 (Configured)
```

### 2. **Adjust Slot Count (Optional)**

- Select the BestOfNNode in canvas
- Find `num_candidates` in Properties panel
- Click ↑ ↓ arrows or type a number (1-10)
- Default is 5, but templates auto-set to their value

### 3. **Connect Your Models**

```
Best-of-3: Connect to candidate1, candidate2, candidate3
Best-of-5: Connect to candidate1-5
Custom:    Connect to however many you set
```

### 4. **Run!**

```
Flow Menu → Run Current Flow
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Q: I set num_candidates=5 but only connected 3 models

**A:** You'll see a warning dialog, but it continues with 3. Always connect as many models as you set num_candidates to.

### Q: Can I have more than 10 candidates?

**A:** Not currently. 10 covers all common use cases. Contact if you need more!

### Q: Does changing num_candidates affect saved flows?

**A:** Yes, the property is saved. When you reopen the flow, it remembers your setting.

### Q: Old flow shows num_candidates=0 or missing

**A:** Defaults to 5. Flows created before this feature work automatically at the default.

## ⚡ Tips & Tricks

✅ **Match num_candidates to connected models** for best results  
✅ **Use Best-of-3 for fast feedback** during development  
✅ **Use Best-of-5+ for final results** with more diversity  
✅ **Test with 2 models** to validate flow before expanding  
✅ **Collapse properties** if you don't need to adjust num_candidates

## 📂 Template Defaults

| Template               | num_candidates | Auto-Set?        |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Best-of-5 (OpenRouter) | 5              | ✅ Yes           |
| Best-of-5 (Configured) | 5              | ✅ Yes           |
| Best-of-3 (Configured) | 3              | ✅ Yes           |
| Blank BestOfN Node     | 5              | ✅ Yes (default) |

## 🎓 Common Workflows

### Workflow: Testing with 2 Models

```
1. Create 2 LLM nodes
2. Select BestOfN node
3. Set num_candidates = 2
4. Connect both models
5. Run flow
→ Quick test, low API costs
```

### Workflow: Production Best-of-5

```
1. Load "Best-of-5 (Configured)" template
2. num_candidates auto-set to 5
3. All connections pre-configured
4. Just add API keys and run
→ Professional output, tested configuration
```

### Workflow: Scaling Up to 7

```
1. Start with Best-of-5 template
2. Add 2 more LLM nodes
3. Set num_candidates = 7
4. Connect new models to candidate6, candidate7
5. Run
→ More diversity, more complete analysis
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Load a template** and run your first synthesis
2. **Experiment with different num_candidates** (3, 5, 7)
3. **Measure synthesis time** vs. quality for your use case
4. **Create your optimal template** and save it
